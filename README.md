# Sitemason Boilerplate Template

For beginners and masters alike, the Sitemason Boilerplate template is a great place to start your project. We are constantly improving Sitemason, and we'll make additions to the boilerplate to take advantage of new Sitemason features as they come online. Even if you're a pro and feel real comfortable with Sitemason, it's always a great place to look and see if any major changes or updates have been made that could benefit your project.

If much of this looks familiar, it's not a coincidence. Most of it is influenced by, if not pulled directly from, the fantastic work being done at html5boilerplate.com.
